# Financial KPI Analysis for Startup (Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters) ‚òïüìä

This project focuses on a comprehensive financial Key Performance Indicator (KPI) analysis for Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters, a prominent startup. The analysis encompasses data cleaning, in-depth financial and cohort analysis, data visualization, and a final interactive dashboard.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to understand the financial health and customer behavior of Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters. This involved:

* **Data Cleaning and Initial Analysis (Excel):** üßπ Preparing the raw financial data for further analysis.
* **Deeper Analysis & Cohort Analysis (Google Colab with Python):** üî¨ Uncovering trends, calculating key financial metrics, and performing cohort analysis to understand customer lifetime value and retention.
* **Data Visualization (Google Colab with Python):** üìà Creating insightful visualizations to represent the findings.
* **Interactive Dashboard (Power BI):** üñ•Ô∏è Developing a user-friendly and interactive dashboard for stakeholders to easily monitor key financial performance indicators.

## Project Structure

* `data/`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets (e.g., Excel files).
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks (or `.py` scripts) used in Google Colab for data analysis and visualization.
* `powerbi/`: Power BI project files (`.pbix`) and any related assets.
* `images/`: Screenshots or exports of the Power BI dashboard.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Analysis and Methodologies

### 1. Data Cleaning and Initial Analysis (Excel)

* **Tool:** Microsoft Excel
* **Process:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, corrected data types, and performed initial sanity checks on the financial data. Basic aggregations and summary statistics were also computed.

### 2. Deeper Analysis & Cohort Analysis (Google Colab with Python)

* **Tool:** Google Colab (Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy)
* **Key Analyses:**
    * **Financial Metrics:** Calculation of revenue, profit, operating expenses, marketing spend, customer acquisition cost (CAC), lifetime value (LTV), and profit margin.
    * **Cohort Analysis:** Grouped customers by their acquisition date to track their behavior (e.g., spending, retention) over time. This helped in understanding customer lifetime value and identifying trends in customer engagement.

### 3. Data Visualization (Google Colab with Python)

* **Tool:** Google Colab (Python with libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
* **Visualizations:** Created various charts and graphs to illustrate financial trends, customer cohorts, and other key insights derived from the data.

### 4. Final Dashboard (Power BI)

* **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Purpose:** To present the key financial KPIs and insights in an interactive and easily digestible format. The dashboard allows for dynamic filtering and exploration of the data.
